## Football Match Result Prediction and Analysis

### Overview

This repository contains code for analyzing and predicting football match results based on key features. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The code utilizes Python with popular libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.

### Questions Addressed in the Analysis

1. What does the distribution of key features look like?
2. Which features are identified as having a significant impact on predicting match outcomes according to the correlation analysis?
3. How has the team's overall performance, encompassing both attack and defensive aspects, evolved over the last three seasons?
4. How do penalty kicks and free kicks contribute to winning a match?
5. Does the home-field advantage, fan attendance, and time of the match have a significant impact on the results?
6. What relations can be observed between shot metrics (sh, sot) and the distance of shots (dist) to match results?
7. What are the key features that contribute the most to the match result?
8. Does the team's scoring rate have a relation with the match result?
9. Which features contribute the least to the match result?

### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

The code includes exploratory data analysis to answer the questions above. It explores the distribution of key numerical features, analyzes the outcomes of matches between specific teams, and visualizes total goals scored, conceded, and average expected goals.

### Data Preprocessing

The preprocessing steps include handling missing values, converting categorical features into numerical ones, and addressing outliers in selected features. The code also implements data cleaning techniques to enhance the quality of the dataset.

### Model Fitting

The code fits a multiple linear regression model using the normal equation to predict match outcomes based on selected features. It calculates metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R2 score for model evaluation. The model is then adjusted by including an intercept term for improved accuracy.

### Results and Visualization

The final results include a dataframe with actual and predicted match outcomes, a confusion matrix visualization, and insights into the model's performance.

### Usage

To use the code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas`, `numpy`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`).
2. Download the dataset (`matches.csv`) and place it in the same directory as the code.
3. Run the code cells in a Jupyter Notebook or script.

### Note

The dataset was scraped from the Premier League site using Beautiful Soup. The analysis and prediction are based on the features available in the dataset.

Feel free to explore, modify, and extend the code to suit your specific analysis or prediction requirements. Enjoy analyzing football match data!
